##An FTP directory brute forcing tool for when the LIST command is disabled
When the LIST command has been disabled on FTP servers you can still enumerate existing dirs by trying to create them. This script tries to create a lot of dirs in order to find out which exist. THey seem to disappear upon reconnecting. Use at your own risk.
